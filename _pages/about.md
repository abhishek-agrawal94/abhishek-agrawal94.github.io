I am currently a PhD student at Aix-Marseille Université under the supervision of [Abdellah Fourtassi](https://afourtassi.github.io/) and [Benoit Favre](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/benoit.favre/). I am a part of the LIS (Laboratoire d’Informatique et Systèmes) lab and the Institute of Language, Communication & the Brain (ILCB). My background is in computational linguistics (Master's degree at Charles University, Prague) and computer science (Bachelor's degree from the University of Pune).

I am primarily interested in studying the development of children's conversational skills in naturalistic environments. For this purpose, I make use of machine learning models from Natural Language Processing (NLP) as proxies for analysing the behaviour of children having social interactions on a large scale.
